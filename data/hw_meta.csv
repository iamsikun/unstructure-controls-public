With help of others (hereby thank you for their help given), I managed to neuter and vaccinate Mummy 2. Next would be Mummy 1. As I believe miracle will always happen.

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens.

Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated.

Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them.

We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping ""Oreo"" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted ""Oreo"" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found ""Oreo"" in some where.

Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.",b912b1114,5.0,2

Coco remained faithful and waited outside the prev.owner's house although with great pain. The prev.owner would then use a cane to whip him and use pesticides to spray onto his inflammed region. My friend saw and rescused the dog. My friend then approached me to foster Coco (to nurse him back to health). My hubby agreed with the condition that Coco to be adopted after he is well and fit as Hubby is not an animal lover. Coco has been with us for slightly over 1 month now.

Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",86547ad6d,5.0,4

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

A nice lady found me in Nilam Terraces in Puchong sometime in end April. She asked the neighbourhood guards about me but no one knew who I belonged to and the guards said I'd been wandering around for 2 weeks. The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me. So my carer who has a fondness for anime decided to call me Chibi (""small"" in Japanese) and help me look for a new home. I may be small in stature (only 6kgs!) but will readily bark to alert you to someone at the door! I love to be snuggled - belly rubs are the best! I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?"" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to partially cover vaccination, deworming, heartworm test/prevention, tick + flea prevention and skin treatment. 4. If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :)",43b277272,6.0,3

Blackie Boy responds well to his name, and will look up everytime he's called, and knows the command come. He enjoys food, especially pure chunks of chicken breast, high 5 bread with butter (though the vet's advised not to give him butter as it's bad for dog's pancrease), and his kibbles! He loves crunching on kibbles, and doggie-snacks! Blackie Boy is available to a good home with loving family members who'd spend some time with him and ensure he gets to roam free in the garden. He's ideal for families and especially those who love dogs! Note: he's a penchant to escape from homes where he doesn't feel loved, whereas at his fosterers..even when he strays out, he'd hang around just outside the home, knowing there's love and security there.

I've been sparing my extra money to buy her dry foods, toys and bed but vaccination and spay is too costly for me. Since that cookie is staying in my room, she never had gone outside and meet other cats, so i think it would be best that the adopter has no other cats at all cuz i'm not sure if she is used to other cats. it would be best also to keep her indoor only because she isn't used going out anymore and also prevent her from getting flees. Cookie is % has no flees as i bath her regularly and she also sleeps on my bed. Adopter must spay her as well. Provided with: 1. Food and Sand 2. Collar 3. Food Bowl and water 4. Bed 5.

Unfortunately for us, we are unable to provide him the attention that he deserves as we have full time jobs as well as 2 other dogs, a bird and 3 guinea pigs at home to care for! He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo.

She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",281618ba5,26.0,3
