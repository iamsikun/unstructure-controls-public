With help of others (hereby thank you for their help given), I managed to neuter and vaccinate Mummy 2. Next would be Mummy 1. As I believe miracle will always happen.

Biscuit and herself both have adorable kink tails just like Miso (both listed on my account). She has a personality as sweet as her name, and she likes mewing gently for permission to lounge on our laps. She is a little more shy compared to her siblings but she easily warms up to you. Adopters must continue to deworm, vaccinate and NEUTER. Preferably kept strictly indoors, and allowed to roam and climb around. Been toilet trained. Been fed AvoDerm canned cat food, so please do not feed lower quality kibbles. Please message or WhatsApp to enquire more about the cats.",60ce9e319,7.0,1
